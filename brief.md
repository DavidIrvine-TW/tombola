tombola Technical Test
The challenge is to build a lightweight application to display the criteria in the test. We realise
everyone has different levels of skill and experience when it comes to development, so we have
listed two separate scenarios in this task for you to choose from. You can combine both if you
wish or focus solely on one of the two scenarios provided.
The Brief
You should use development best practices where appropriate, supporting principles we value
including; security, performance, readability, testability, scalability, simplicity. You should also aim
to achieve a clean separation of concerns between components in your solution.
The scenarios are based on the business All The Beans who wants to market their products daily
with a “bean of the day” mechanic.
Scenario 1
1. Create a responsive layout using modern UI frameworks or libraries.
2. Using the attached JSON file implement components to display:
 List of available coffee beans.
 Detailed view of a selected coffee bean.
 &quot;Bean of the Day&quot; feature which is interactable for more information.
3. Create an order form for customers to purchase coffee beans.
4. Implement a search feature to filter coffee beans by the available data.
Scenario 2
1. Design and implement a relational database schema to store the bean details from the JSON
file provided.
2. Create RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for coffee beans and Fetch the &quot;Bean of the
Day&quot;.
3. Implement business logic to ensure:
 Each day, a new &quot;Bean of the Day&quot; is selected randomly from the available beans.
 The selected bean cannot be the same as the previous day.
4. Implement a database search feature to show products available

The Deliverable
 A bundled/archived repository showing your commit history or a link to an accessible private
repository with your work in. We recommend Github.
 A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.
 Any instructions required to run your solution and tests.
Assessment Policy
We consider all candidates equally, fairly and without bias. To that end, we ask that you do not
leave any personally identifying information in your submission (such as your name within an
author field or file, or in use as test data).
